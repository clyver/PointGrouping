Before solving this problem, I wanted to gain a sense for how applicable and consistent geohashes are.
To do this, I did a simple experiment utilizing the points from sample_points.json.  I created geohashes
for each of these points, listed here:

    - A shuffled list of hashes:
        manhattan3
        london1
        brooklyn2
        athens1
        paris1
        bronx3
        moscow2
        manhattan1
        london2
        manhattan2
        cairo2
        bronx1
        paris2
        manhattan4
        cairo1
        brooklyn1
        moscow1
        bronx2
        athens2
        brooklyn3

I then sorted these hashes, hoping to see groupings and trends.  The results of which are listed here:

    The sorted list of hashes:
        brooklyn2
        brooklyn1
        brooklyn3
        manhattan1
        manhattan2
        manhattan3
        manhattan4
        bronx1
        bronx2
        bronx3
        london1
        london2
        cairo2
        cairo1
        athens2
        athens1
        paris2
        paris1
        moscow2
        moscow1

The results of this experiment show that geohashes certainly do a good job at signifying 'like' points, especially
at the micro level.  At the macro level, I would have liked to seen more fluid transitions, for example London
should have been followed by Paris, not Cairo.  That being said, geohashes accomplish a lot of the heavy lifting.
